# Tech-Tesser-Assignment

In this Project...
 have developed a webpage featuring a static image as its primary visual element, accompanied by an interactive text component. This text section is designed to dynamically respond to user inputs, allowing for real-time adjustments to its appearance. Users can customize various typographical attributes such as font-family, font-size, font-weight, color, and alignment. This interactive functionality enhances user engagement by providing them with the flexibility to personalize the visual presentation according to their preferences.
